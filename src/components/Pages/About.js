                        I'm a 28 year old nurse turned web developer. 
                        Due to our family situation, I've been looking at transportable 
                        career options and stumbled upon coding which was a surprising 
                        choice for me! In saying that, I've found the steep learning curve
                        fascinating and am growing quite passionate about coding. 
                        My husband and I have 2 small children and tend
                        to travel around the countryside for his work quite a bit. 
                        I love being outdoors and as a family, we enjoy many
                        different outdoor activities including camping, hiking,
                        snorkelling, paragliding, kitesurfing, etc.
